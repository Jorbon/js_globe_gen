# js_globe_gen
Uses layered perlin noise to generate a mesh and texture for a procedurally generated earth-like planet model. This is rendered using a slightly modified Three.js library.

Code is live at: https://jorbon.github.io/js_globe_gen
There is a long load time due to the number of samples made.
